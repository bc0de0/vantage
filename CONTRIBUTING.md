# Contributing to Project Vantage

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Project Vantage**.

Vantage is an open-source system built to support **disciplined, AI-assisted sense-making** in adversarial and high-uncertainty environments. Contributions are welcome — but they must align with the project’s purpose and design philosophy.

This document exists to ensure that contributions strengthen, rather than dilute, the system.

---

## Guiding Principles

All contributions to Vantage must respect the following principles:

- **Selection over execution**  
- **Meaning before action**  
- **Evidence over intuition**  
- **AI assists reasoning, it does not hold authority**  
- **Human judgment remains central**

If a proposed change conflicts with these principles, it will not be merged into the canonical repository.

## What Makes a Good Contribution

We welcome contributions that improve:

### 1. Reasoning Quality
- Clearer modeling of intent, context, or state
- Improvements to how techniques are compared or evaluated
- Better handling of uncertainty, assumptions, or tradeoffs

### 2. Technique Definitions
- New or improved technique descriptions
- Clearer metadata, constraints, or reasoning hooks
- Domain expansions (e.g., red team, OSINT, fraud) **without execution logic**

### 3. Documentation & Teaching Value
- Clarifying architecture or design intent
- Improving onboarding for new readers
- Explaining *why* the system works the way it does

### 4. Testing & Validation
- Tests that strengthen confidence in reasoning behavior
- Validation of assumptions and invariants
- Improvements that increase auditability

## Out of Scope Contributions

To preserve the integrity of the project, the following types of contributions will **not** be accepted into the canonical repository:

- Execution or action layers
- Tool runners or command invokers
- Automation frameworks or workflow engines
- “Optional” execution flags or helper scripts
- Features that transfer decision authority away from the human operator

Forks are free to explore these directions.  
The canonical Vantage project will not.

## How to Contribute

1. **Open an Issue First (Recommended)**  
   Describe the change you are considering and how it aligns with Vantage’s goals.

2. **Be Explicit About Intent**  
   Explain *why* the change improves selection, reasoning, or clarity.

3. **Keep Changes Focused**  
   Small, well-justified contributions are preferred over large, sweeping changes.

4. **Preserve Architectural Boundaries**  
   Avoid cross-layer coupling or shortcuts that weaken separation of concerns.

---

## Review Process

All contributions are reviewed with an emphasis on:

- Conceptual correctness
- Alignment with project mission
- Long-term maintainability
- Impact on epistemic clarity

Not all rejections indicate low quality.  
Many indicate misalignment — and that is expected in a principled project.

---

## Community Expectations

We aim to foster a community that values:
- Thoughtfulness over speed
- Clarity over cleverness
- Respectful disagreement
- Intellectual honesty

Please keep discussions professional, grounded, and focused on ideas rather than individuals.

---

## Final Note

Project Vantage is intentionally opinionated.

That is not a barrier to contribution — it is the framework within which meaningful collaboration can occur.

If you are excited by systems that prioritize **judgment, restraint, and clarity**, your contributions are welcome.
